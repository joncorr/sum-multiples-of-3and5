# sum-multiples-of-3and5

My clojure solution to the first problem of the Euler project (https://projecteuler.net/problem=1). After completing my second clojure solution and revisiting my C# solution of this problem, I thought it was time to write a Clojure solution to the first problem. This one is mor succinct than the C# version. =)
